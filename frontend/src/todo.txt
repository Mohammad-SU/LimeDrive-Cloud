Priority:
    - Deleting (add to processing items, remove from processing items in finally, deal with selected items removing/adding, backend)
    - underline/bold sidebar links if user is in that section,
    - Add checks in uploadInfo link elements for if file is deleted or in trash
    - Previews
    - Downloading, Renaming
    - finish implementing search function
    - finish sorting toolbar logic
    - full page animations with DynamicClip
    - e2e tests with cypress (mainly file upload and deletion, possibly folder)
    - implement "space left" on bottom left corner
    - settings page, toast notifications
    - Suggested with thumbnails on all files page, and recents page
    - malware check
    - make website title reflect page/folder accurately
    - Default files/folders with restore button (Tips and info readme such as shortcuts, short gif/videos, pictures, documents, etc.)
    - favicon
    - Repsonsive CSS, Check multiple browsers (firefox android folder upload webkitdirectory), long press for opening files/folders on touch devices
    - test thoroughly
    - Add to portfolio
    - Starring
    - Sharing
    - add tooltips with bulb icon (in gap inside toolbar/space after sorting categories?)
    - handle folder name and path name limits with file names
    - fix date when daylight savings time (try get timezone offset? laravel settings/save timezone on database and deal with conversions?)
    - add functionality for deleting older user accounts when new user created and space is getting low
    - react virtualisation for large lists

change directory mentions to folder instead
for main sections add general scss to MainPage.scss (such as the title where the breadcrumb is the, the general list/header row scss? and other stuff. so that scss code isnt duplicated too much)
set currentPath to root (LimeDrive/) when user goes to a separate/unrelated page
disable all toolbar btns when no selected items and also return from functions

Deleting (future?):
    - confirmation, and then move to recycle bin? check what dropbox/google drive does
    - move selection code into a custom hook?

Previews:
    - change preview toolbar button to "open" if folder is selected, and hide this button if multiple items are selected
    - in preview, add extra buttons such as open in new tab/download, etc, use dropbox/google drive for inspiration

make it so navigating in url in code (such as when creating folder and jump linking) adds targeted class manually, and timeout adds targeted-style class only (and removes targeted class) if location changed AND targeted class is already present on the element (prevents problems with going back in url causing re-highlight)
change margin top of move modal heading (also change heights of folders in there so their borders dont look weird in that case)
when adding delay for open file on double click, remember escape key press timeout clear code
box shadow for newMenu and other modals?
fix text in buttons looking vertically off-center (move toolbar, breadcrumb drodown, possibly other dropdowns/buttons too) by adding padding bottom?
toast notification stacking
remember to put toast notifications for errors
adjust scrolls/item sizes so they dont cause unnecessary scrollbars/item borders being too close to screen edges
vertically align text in buttons?
aria labels
make it so if there is a loading toast and it is overwritten, then the loading toast should be queued to come back after it is overwritten
backend validation for duplicate item name checking when moving and uploading, if folder is going to be child of itself when moving (check parent_folder_id for duplicate item names and child of itself), etc
fix handleDragEnd working when target folder is below toolbar but hidden due to z index (add early return in handleDragEnd if droppedonfolder being under something/filelist header by more than 70-60%)

instead of delaying item selection, make item selection instant and implement below suggestion? Or implement below suggestion without removing selection delay? 
for folder opening use delay clip animation on entire main-list/list items? Although it may be annoying for users who want to open folders quickly

more detailed errors, such as if folder/file doesnt exist on database cause a backend error and then tell the user that the folder/file doesnt exist
folder uploading, check each folder and subfolder to make sure their folder names follow the valid format (test by invalidating normal characters), remove if true condition on file selection handlefileselect condition
instantly close maintoolbar if only one selected item and was double-clicked for opening withing certain remaining amount of milliseconds from select delay and toolbar animation (!showToolbarInstant || isToolbarVisible as render jsx conditions? use useeffect and/or context?)
add folder creation jump link as button on toast so user can choose to jump to it, but still highlight on folder creation regardless by adding targeted class manually
add short scss animations for conflict icons and tooltips?
change all filetype foldertype combinations to ItemTypes if better
make tabbing to a file name and pressing enter cause it to open (use useGlobalEnterKey hook?)
add more specific/better icons for files in FileList and UploadInfo
implement all toolbar functions
implement sorting categories in the place of toolbar when no files are selected
implement more server-side validation for files and folders (size, allowed characters)?
check for duplication when user tries to add folders, prevent folder creation if there is duplicate in same path
decrease header sizings?
file list sorting based on header row label/arrow icon clicks
add left click dropdown menu
file sharing
settings page
gallery
starred
filters for deleted section (allow users to search non-deleted folders to see if it had any items in the recycle bin)
make selecting an item and then copying it/pressing ctrl c make it add to a state (not clipboard) so user can paste it into another folder or so
check if file extension column is not needed on database and then remove if so
add backgrounds/more details for loading pages
add info and tips readme file that is stored in all user's file list
add default files/folders for showcasing along with "restore default files" if user's want them back if they deleted them (without resetting user data and tell them that this won't)
email verification
allow Google and Facebook to be used for logins? (OAuth)
remove useState import from all files where it's not used
change backend env secret file for render.com if changed
add more automated tests with cypress (e2e and possibly integration test)
implement Redis?
thoroughly test app
clear laravel storage log
prevent file/folder hover styles during click delay?
create new folder button in move modal
better backend validation
research accessibility and improve it on the app
add folders on sidebar
divider element in newMenu in sidebar that has margin top and bottom similar to newMenu's top and bottom padding
different layouts for filelist
add help section?
stricter security features such as password-protected file/folders/ and encryption, decryption keys?
