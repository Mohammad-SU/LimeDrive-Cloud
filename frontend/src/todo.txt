implement rest of move modal:
    - add toast msg if user attempts to move their only selected folder inside itself
    - moving logic
    - similar validation for movebtn click function for disabled attribute
    - disable move btn during processing
    - when multiple selected items and invalid target folders for some items, continue move but tell user that only some of all items were moved

add option on Modal component to show close/x btn.
for breadcrumb - instead of window resize event always running overflow check, make it only run it if breadcrumb width has changed, possibly add breadcrumb width to deps?
implement rest of breadcrumb (animations, hiddensegments btnonly, really long single item to show up on its own in visiblesegments, overflow in dropdown)
hide overflow for long item names in drag overlay
make "creating folder..." show as toast
fix long item names causing icons to disappear
fix text overflow next line when uploadInfo is collapsed and spinner is visible
show user how many items are selected on corner of screen on breadcrumb level
bold end of path in breadcrumbs or reduce opacity of what is before it?
fix file upload selection where user selecting same file again if it was the directly previous selected file not working
Make "in <folder>" in uploadInfo a jump link and highlight/blink the file after jumping to it, also correct it so the links are correct
check for duplication when uploading - add (1) or more numbers to end of file name if there is a duplicate in same path
implement "space left" on bottom left corner

Priority: 
    - Moving
    - Deleting, set currentPath to root (LimeDrive/) when user goes to a separate/unrelated page, toast notifications, underline/bold sidebar links if user is on that page
    - Previews
    - folder uploading, allow more variety in folder characters
    - finish implementing search function
    - file sorting in place of toolbar when its not visible
    - full page animations with DynamicClip
    - e2e tests with cypress (mainly file upload and deletion, possibly folder)
    - settings page, toast notifications
    - Recents with thumbnails on all files page, and recents page
    - make website title reflect page/folder accurately
    - Default files/folders with restore button (Tips and info readme such as shortcuts, short gif/videos, pictures, documents, etc.)
    - favicon
    - Repsonsive CSS, long press for opening files/folders on touch devices
    - test thoroughly
    - Add to portfolio
    - Starring, toast notifications
    - Sharing
    - add tooltips with bulb icon (in gap inside toolbar/space after sorting categories?)
    - handle folder name and path name limits with file names
    - fix date when daylight savings time (try get timezone offset? laravel settings/save timezone on database and deal with conversions?)
    - add functionality for deleting older users when new user created and space is getting low, etc, and then add extra info under login form for invalid details that the invalid username may be a deleted account and the user can register it, possibly with a hover tooltip for the extra info? or add the info to the side of the login form

Deleting:
    - confirmation, and then move to recycle bin, make it so items must be restored to preview/open folders if there are any with file counts inside? check what dropbox/google drive does?

Previews:
    - change preview toolbar button to "open" if folder is selected, and hide this button if multiple items are selected

toast notifications for errors
adjust scrolls/item sizes so they dont cause unnecessary scrollbars
vertically align text in buttons?
aria labels

add short scss animations for conflict icons and tooltips?
change all filetype foldertype combinations to ItemTypes if better
make it so after file is uploaded, the file in UploadInfo component accurately reflects the directory path that the file was uploaded to
move to and highlight new folder after user creates it
make tabbing to a file name and pressing enter cause it to open (use useGlobalEnterKey hook?)
add more specific/better icons for files in FileList and UploadInfo
implement all toolbar functions
implement sorting categories in the place of toolbar when no files are selected
implement more server-side validation for files and folders (size, allowed characters)?
check for duplication when user tries to add folders, prevent folder creation if there is duplicate in same path
decrease header sizings?
box shadows?
file list sorting based on header row label/arrow icon clicks
shift click for item selection
add left click dropdown menu
file sharing
settings page
react virtualisation for large lists
gallery
starred
malware check
check if file extension column is not needed on database and then remove if so
add backgrounds/more details for loading pages
add info and tips readme file that is stored in all user's file list
add default files/folders for showcasing along with "restore default files" if user's want them back if they deleted them (without resetting user data and tell them that this won't)
responsive CSS and check if correct on other browsers
email verification
allow Google and Facebook to be used for logins? (OAuth)
remove useState import from all files where it's not used
change backend env secret file for render.com if changed
add more automated tests with cypress (e2e and possibly integration test)
implement Redis?
thoroughly test app
clear laravel storage log
prevent file/folder hover styles during click delay?
create new folder button in move modal
better backend validation
research accessibility and improve it on the app

future update ideas:
    undo btn/features
    show conflict resolution modal when conflicts detected during move operations
