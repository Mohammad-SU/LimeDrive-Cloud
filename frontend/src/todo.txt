check for duplication when uploading - add (1) or more numbers to end of file name if there is a duplicate in same path

Priority: 
    - Deleting, set currentPath to root (LimeDrive/) when user goes to a separate/unrelated page, toast notifications, underline/bold sidebar links if user is on that page
    - Add checks in uploadInfo link elements for if file is deleted or in trash
    - Previews
    - folder uploading, allow more variety in folder characters
    - finish implementing search function
    - finish sorting toolbar logic
    - full page animations with DynamicClip
    - e2e tests with cypress (mainly file upload and deletion, possibly folder)
    - settings page, toast notifications
    - Recents with thumbnails on all files page, and recents page
    - make website title reflect page/folder accurately
    - Default files/folders with restore button (Tips and info readme such as shortcuts, short gif/videos, pictures, documents, etc.)
    - favicon
    - Repsonsive CSS, long press for opening files/folders on touch devices
    - test thoroughly
    - Add to portfolio
    - Starring, toast notifications
    - Sharing
    - add tooltips with bulb icon (in gap inside toolbar/space after sorting categories?)
    - handle folder name and path name limits with file names
    - fix date when daylight savings time (try get timezone offset? laravel settings/save timezone on database and deal with conversions?)
    - add functionality for deleting older users when new user created and space is getting low, etc, and then add extra info under login form for invalid details that the invalid username may be a deleted account and the user can register it, possibly with a hover tooltip for the extra info? or add the info to the side of the login form
    - implement "space left" on bottom left corner
    - react virtualisation for large lists

Deleting:
    - confirmation, and then move to recycle bin, make it so items must be restored to preview/open folders if there are any with file counts inside? check what dropbox/google drive does?

Previews:
    - change preview toolbar button to "open" if folder is selected, and hide this button if multiple items are selected

box shadow for newMenu and other modals?
fix text in buttons looking vertically off-center (move toolbar, breadcrumb drodown, possibly other dropdowns/buttons too) by adding padding bottom?
toast notification stacking
remember to put toast notifications for some errors
adjust scrolls/item sizes so they dont cause unnecessary scrollbars
vertically align text in buttons?
aria labels
make it so if there is a loading toast and it is overwritten, then the loading toast should be queued to come back after it is overwritten
more complex logic to allow for users to conduct multiple move operations quickly
backend validation for duplicate item name checking when moving and uploading, if folder is going to be child of itself when moving (check parent_folder_id for duplicate item names and child of itself), etc
instantly close maintoolbar if only one selected item and was double-clicked for opening withing certain remaining amount of milliseconds from select delay and toolbar animation (!showToolbarInstant || isToolbarVisible as render jsx conditions? use useeffect and/or context?)

add short scss animations for conflict icons and tooltips?
change all filetype foldertype combinations to ItemTypes if better
make tabbing to a file name and pressing enter cause it to open (use useGlobalEnterKey hook?)
add more specific/better icons for files in FileList and UploadInfo
implement all toolbar functions
implement sorting categories in the place of toolbar when no files are selected
implement more server-side validation for files and folders (size, allowed characters)?
check for duplication when user tries to add folders, prevent folder creation if there is duplicate in same path
decrease header sizings?
file list sorting based on header row label/arrow icon clicks
shift click for item selection
add left click dropdown menu
file sharing
settings page
gallery
starred
malware check
check if file extension column is not needed on database and then remove if so
add backgrounds/more details for loading pages
add info and tips readme file that is stored in all user's file list
add default files/folders for showcasing along with "restore default files" if user's want them back if they deleted them (without resetting user data and tell them that this won't)
responsive CSS and check if correct on other browsers
email verification
allow Google and Facebook to be used for logins? (OAuth)
remove useState import from all files where it's not used
change backend env secret file for render.com if changed
add more automated tests with cypress (e2e and possibly integration test)
implement Redis?
thoroughly test app
clear laravel storage log
prevent file/folder hover styles during click delay?
create new folder button in move modal
better backend validation
research accessibility and improve it on the app
add folders on sidebar
divider element in newMenu in sidebar that has margin top and bottom similar to newMenu's top and bottom padding
