    - fix overflow on long breadcrumb
    - display empty directory msg for empty folders in it
    - arrow for directories that have folders in them
    - allow tabbing on folder names

                        {index === 0 && collapse &&
                            <>
                                <button className="icon-btn-wrapper" onClick={() => setShowDropdown(current => !current)}>
                                    <BsThreeDots className="dots-icon icon-btn"/>
                                </button>
                                {isDropdownVisible &&
                                    <nav className="dropdown">
                                        test
